This was part of the second assignment in a brand new class called Cross-Platform Mobile Web Apps (15-237) at Carnegie Mellon. We had to create a form that would collect information and display it the DOM at the bottom of the page, and then clear the form. 
Everything is done on the client-side in javascript, HTML5, and CSS3.

You can download the source code and click on collection.html to run it.
